  abstract  = {We present a new tensoring technique for LWE-based fully homomorphic encryption. While in all previous works, the ciphertext noise grows quadratically ({\$}{\$}B {\backslash}rightarrow B^2{\backslash}cdot {\backslash}text {\{}poly{\}}(n){\$}{\$}) with every multiplication (before ``refreshing''), our noise only grows linearly ({\$}{\$}B {\backslash}rightarrow B{\backslash}cdot {\backslash}text {\{}poly{\}}(n){\$}{\$}).},
