\begin{abstract}
Existing blockchain networks are often large-scale, requiring transactions to be synchronized across the entire network to reach consensus, and on-chain computations can be prohibitively expensive, making many CPU-sensitive computations infeasible.

Inspired by the structure of IBM's token ring networks, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol called Monadring to address these issues. Monadring allows nodes that are already part of a large blockchain network to form a smaller subnetwork to perform computations more quickly and cheaply, while still maintaining the same security guarantees as the main blockchain network.

To further enhance the security of Monadring, we introduce a node rotation mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and blind voting based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within the smaller subnetwork. Unlike the common voting-based election of validator nodes, the election in Monadring leverages FHE to hide the voting information, eliminating the advantage of the last mover in the voting game.

The paper details the design and implementation of the Monadring protocol, and evaluates its performance and feasibility through simulation experiments. This research contributes to enhancing the practical utility of blockchain technology in large-scale application scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
Recent blockchain systems have often adopted faster and more energy-efficient consensus protocols like Ouroboros, BABE, and Tendermint.
Blockchain networks are typically open and permissionless, and we can define the degree of decentralization of such networks by the number of participating nodes.
Leveraging the consensus protocols mentioned earlier, it is possible to rapidly construct new blockchain networks.
However, decentralized applications often cannot flexibly customize their degree of decentralization based on the importance of their underlying data.

For example, decentralized social media applications may require faster response times and lower storage costs compared to decentralized finance applications, and hence may need a lower degree of decentralization.
This flexibility to adjust the level of decentralization based on the needs of the application is an important consideration that has not been fully addressed in existing blockchain architectures.

Building a subnetwork over an existing blockchain system is a possible way to address this issue.
By drawing inspiration from the token ring architecture, we propose a novel consensus protocol called Monadring that aims to enable nodes within an existing blockchain network to form smaller, lightweight subnetworks capable of performing computations more efficiently and cost-effectively, while still maintaining the same security guarantees as the main blockchain.

Token ring network operates at the data link layer of the OSI/RM model.
It was designed to solve the problem of physical link contention just like Ethernet.
In a token ring network, a token is passed sequentially from one node to the next, granting the holder the right to transmit data.
This token-based system for managing access to the shared medium bears some similarity to the consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks for selecting block producer.

Despite the fact that token ring networks have largely fallen out of favor in modern networking due to their limited scalability and other drawbacks, the underlying principles of their decentralized, token-based structure could provide valuable insights for designing a lightweight consensus algorithm for small blockchain systems.

Monadring also involves FHE-based member rotation mechanism to enhance the security.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a method of encryption that allows computations to be carried out on encrypted data, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the outcome of computations performed on the plaintext.
This property enables sophisticated computations on encrypted data while maintaining data security.
HE schemes are a type of encryption method that can protect data privacy because they allow computations to be performed directly on the encrypted data.
For example, an HE scheme might allow a user to perform operations like addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers, and these operations would have the same result as if they were performed on the original, unencrypted numbers.
This technology is seen as a key component for secure cloud computing since it allows complex data manipulations to be carried out on completely secure encrypted data.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a more advanced form of Homomorphic Encryption.
FHE allows arbitrary computations to be carried out on encrypted data, which is not the case with normal HE which might be limited in the types of computation it supports.
FHE computations generate a result that, when decrypted, corresponds to the result of the same computations performed on the plaintext.
This makes FHE extremely useful for cases where sensitive data must be processed or analyzed, but security and privacy considerations prevent the data from being decrypted.
With FHE, you can perform unlimited calculations on this encrypted data just like you would on unencrypted data. For instance, in the field of cloud computing, FHE allows users to operate computations on encrypted data stored in the cloud, preserving data confidentiality and privacy.

In small-scale decentralized networks with randomly determined members, the application of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for voting can be mathematically equivalent to the Prisoner's Dilemma. By incorporating appropriate incentive structures, it is possible to achieve both efficiency and security in such decentralized networks.

\section{Essential Mathematics}
\subsection{FHE}
Some of the more popular FHE frameworks include BFV, BGV and CKKS.

\paragraph{BGV (Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan)}: The BGV scheme is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) method, proposed by Zvika Brakerski, Craig Gentry, and Vinod Vaikuntanathan.
It offers a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or ring-LWE problems that have substantial security against known attacks.
BGV allows the encryption of a single bit at a time and the efficiency of the encryption is largely considered in cloud storage models.
\paragraph{BFV (Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren)}: BFV is another homomorphic encryption scheme that is often considered for its practical performance alongside the BGV scheme.
BFV supports a set of mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication to be performed directly on the encrypted data.
It has been implemented efficiently and there have also been several optimizations proposed to enhance its performance in different applications.
\paragraph{CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song)}: The CKKS scheme is known for being a Leveled Homomorphic Encryption method that supports approximate arithmetic operations over encrypted data.

The CKKS scheme is especially suitable for computations involving real or complex numbers.
Its ability to perform operations on encrypted data without the necessity for decryption makes it highly useful for maintaining data security during computations.

The Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) and Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) schemes differ mainly in how they encode information.
BGV encodes messages in the least significant digit (LSD) of the integer, while BFV encodes messages in the most significant digit (MSD) of the integer.
This difference can affect how the encrypted data is handled and manipulated during computations.

\subsubsection{Mathematic notations of FHE.}
We define the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$ as the set of integers, $\mathbb{Q}$ as the field of rational numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ as the field of real numbers, and $\mathbb{C}$ as the field of complex numbers.

Further, we define the polynomial cyclotomic ring $\mathcal{R}$ as follows: $$\mathcal{R}:=\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N+1)$$ Correspondingly, $\mathcal{R}_q$ is defined as $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})[X]/(X^N+1)$, where typically $N=2^n$, that is, $N$ is an integer power of 2.

We define a distribution as $\chi_{\sigma^2,\mu}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the variance and $\mu$ signifies the mean. The uniform ternary distribution and discrete Gaussian distribution are represented by $\chi_\mathcal{T}$ and $\chi_\mathcal{N}$ respectively. Considering the standard BFV encryption formula: $$\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{s} +\Delta m +\mathbf{e}$$
It's established that $\mathbf{a}\sim\chi_\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathbf{e}\sim\chi_{\mathcal{N}}$.
Wherein, the probability density function of the discrete Gaussian distribution is represented as $\rho_{\mu,\sigma^2}=e^{-\lVert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\mu}\rVert^2/2\sigma^2}$.

The expansion factor $\delta_\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $\lVert \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}\rVert_\infty/(\lVert\mathbf{a}\rVert_\infty\cdot\lVert\mathbf{b}\rVert_\infty)$ where $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in \mathcal{R}$

\subsubsection{Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme.}
Shamir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm in cryptography devised by Adi Shamir. It's a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part. The unique feature of the algorithm is the minimal amount of parts, or shares, needed to reconstruct the secret.
Here's a simple walkthrough of how Shamir's Secret Sharing can be used for threshold private key sharing:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose the Threshold: Define the threshold number $t$ below which knowing $t$ points gives no information about the secret, but $t$ points yields the secret.
\item Generate a Polynomial: Generate a random polynomial of degree $t-1$ with the constant term being the secret (private key) to be shared. i.e. \begin{equation}\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x})=a_0+a_1\mathbf{x}+a_2\mathbf{x}^2+\ldots+a_{t-1}\mathbf{x}^{t-1}
\end{equation}
\item Create Shares: Evaluate the polynomial at different points to get $n$ shares, where $n$ is the total number of participants. Each participant is given one share, which is a point on the polynomial. i.e. \begin{equation}s_i=\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}_i)\end{equation}
\item Distribute the Shares: The shares of the private key are then distributed among the participants.
The key property here is that any $t$ shares (points) are enough to reconstruct the polynomial (and hence discover the secret), whereas $t-1$ or fewer shares reveal no information about the secret.
\item Reconstruct the Secret: When the need arises to use the private key (secret), any $t$ participants come together and combine their shares using polynomial interpolation (for example, via Lagrange interpolation) to reconstruct the polynomial and discover the constant term, which is the secret.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(x)=\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}s_i\prod_{j\neq i}\frac{x-s_j}{s_i-s_j}
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}
It is worth noting that all polynomials are defined over the ring of polynomials in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})[X]/X^{t}$ and the Lagrange interpolation still holds.

This way, the private key (secret) is never explicitly revealed to any single party and no single party can access the secret alone.
This is particularly useful in managing the risks associated with key management in cryptographic systems.
It provides a balance between accessibility (through the threshold number of participants) and security (no single point of failure).
\subsubsection{Resharing Scheme}
In our scheme, we can construct a ($n$,$t$) key sharing scheme based on the aforementioned algorithm. However, in practical applications, we may need to redistribute the keys. This redistribution, or resharing, refers to the transformation of the original ($n$,$t$) key into a ($n'$,$t'$) key, which can be achieved using the Lagrange interpolation formula.
Let's assume that the key sharing based on ($n$,$t$) is $s$, where $s=\mathcal{P}(0)$. We use $\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{N}_i$ as the Lagrange base of the original ($n$,$t$) key sharing user $\mathcal{N}$. The new ($n'$,$t'$) sharing has a user set of $\mathcal{M}$. Then, we have:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}(0)&=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{N}_is_i=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{N}_i\sum_{j\in\mathcal{M}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{M}_js'_{i,j}\\
&=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{M}}\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{N}_i\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{M}_j\right)s'_{i,j}
=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{M}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{M}_j\sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{N}_is'_{i,j}=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{M}}\mathcal{L}^\mathcal{M}_js'_j
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Mathematically, this is akin to transforming a one-dimensional vector into a two-dimensional matrix. The size of the matrix is $n \times n'$, where any $t \times t'$ submatrix can restore the original key. Thus, the resharing process is equivalent to the transition from users holding row vectors to users holding column vectors. This reshaping provides a flexible way to adjust the distribution of shares without revealing the original secret or requiring all participants to return their shares.

\subsubsection{BFV Scheme.}
As described in the citation \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_50, cryptoeprint:2012/144}, the BFV scheme proposes the method of placing the ciphertext in the Most Significant Digit (MSD) position, which makes the trend of noise growth change from quadratic to linear. This not only greatly reduces the influence of noise in the computation process, but also eliminates the need for modulus switching, thus effectively enhancing the computational efficiency.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{BFV.SecretKeyGen($1^\lambda$)}: Generate a secret key $\texttt{sk}\leftarrow \chi_\mathcal{T}$.
\item \texttt{BFV.PublicKeyGen(\texttt{sk})}: Generate a public key $\texttt{pk} =(\texttt{pk}_0,\texttt{pk}_1)= \left([-\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{s}+\mathbf{e}]_{q}, \mathbf{a}\right)$ where $\mathbf{e}\leftarrow \chi_\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathbf{a}\leftarrow \chi_\mathcal{T}$.
\item \texttt{BFV.Enc($\texttt{pk},\textbf{m}$)}: Message $\mathbf{m}\in \mathcal{R}_p$, where $p<q$. $\mathbf{u}\leftarrow \chi_\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathbf{e}_0, \mathbf{e}_1\leftarrow \chi_\mathcal{N}$. The ciphertext is $$\texttt{ct} = (\texttt{ct}_0,\texttt{ct}_1)=\left([\texttt{pk}_0\cdot\mathbf{u}+\Delta\cdot\mathbf{m}+\mathbf{e}_0]_{q},[\texttt{pk}_1\cdot\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{e}_1]_{q}\right)$$
\item \texttt{BFV.Dec($\texttt{sk},\texttt{ct}$)}: $$\mathbf{m}=\left[\left\lfloor p\cdot[\texttt{ct}_0+\texttt{ct}_1\cdot\mathbf{s}]_q/q\right\rceil\right]_t$$
\end{itemize}
It is worth noting that the BFV scheme differs from the BGV scheme in that the BGV ciphertext is placed in LSD, i.e.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{BGV.PublicKeyGen(\texttt{sk})}: $$\texttt{pk}=([-\mathbf{a}\cdot{s}+p\mathbf{e}]_q, \mathbf{a})$$
\item \texttt{BGV.Enc($\texttt{pk},\textbf{m}$)}: $$\texttt{ct}=([ \mathbf{m}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\texttt{pk}_0+p\mathbf{e}_0]_q,[\mathbf{u}\cdot\texttt{pk}_1+p\mathbf{e}_1]_q)$$
\end{itemize}
We need to evaluate the effect of the encryption function $\texttt{Enc}$ and the decryption function $\texttt{Dec}$ on noise. Consider the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\texttt{ct}_0+\texttt{ct}_1\cdot{s}=\Delta\mathbf{m}+p\mathbf{v}
\end{equation}

The noise $\mathbf{v}$ can be evaluated by $\lVert\mathbf{v}\rVert_\infty < (q-p r_t(q))/(2p)$ where $r_p(q)=q-p\Delta$ which is a value determined by the modulus $q$, the plaintext scaling factor $\Delta$ and the noise ratio $p$.

This condition exists because during the decryption process we actually perform a $p/q$ scaling operation. This scaling operation may amplify the effect of the noise, so we need to make sure that the size of the noise is within an acceptable range before decryption.

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% \texttt{BFV.EvalAdd($\texttt{ct}_1,\texttt{ct}_2$)}&=(\texttt{ct}_1+\texttt{ct}_2)_0,(\texttt{ct}_1+\texttt{ct}_2)_1\\
% \texttt{BFV.EvalMul($\texttt{ct}_1,\texttt{ct}_2$)}&=(\texttt{ct}_1\cdot\texttt{ct}_2)_0,(\texttt{ct}_1\cdot\texttt{ct}_2)_1
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% This chapter primarily addresses the wireless signal strength model, focusing particularly on the signal transmission model applicable to space satellites and terrestrial receivers. Central to the discussion are two key assumptions pivotal to consensus algorithms: spatial continuity and temporal continuity. Instead of delving deep into the intricacies of the related formulas, this chapter accords higher importance to the qualitative conclusions derived from these equations.

\subsection{Game Theory}
\subsubsection{Basic Definitions}
In any game, we have a set of players, denoted by $\mathcal{P}_i=\{1,2,...,n\}$. Each player $i$ in this set has a corresponding strategy space, $\Sigma_i$, which contains all the possible strategies that player $i$ can adopt. A particular strategy that player $i$ chooses to play is represented by $\sigma_i$, which is an element of $\Sigma_i$.
In a multiplayer game, it's often crucial to consider the strategies of the other players when deciding one's own strategy. We denote the strategy profile of all players other than player $i$ by $\sigma_{-i}$, which is an element of $\Sigma_{-i}$. The strategy space $\Sigma_{-i}$ thus represents all possible combinations of strategies for the players other than player $i$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Perfect Information Games:} In a perfect information game, every player has complete knowledge of all past actions and decisions within the game. This means that the sequence of play is fully observable, revealing all actions by all players, for every player.
  \item \textbf{Imperfect Information Games:} An imperfect information game is one in which the entire sequence of previous actions and decisions is not fully observable for all players. Players may have private information, and each player typically has different information regarding the past. The players must then make decisions based on their own private information and whatever public information is available.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nash Equilibrium}
The concept of Nash equilibrium is central to game theory. It represents a state of the game where no player can gain any advantage by unilaterally changing their strategy, given that the strategies of all other players remain fixed.

The best response function of player $i$, denoted by $\texttt{BR}i(\sigma{-i})$, is defined as the strategy that maximizes player $i$'s utility or payoff, $\pi_i$, given the strategies of all other players, $\sigma_{-i}$. Mathematically, this is represented as:
\begin{equation}
\texttt{BR}_i(\sigma_{-i}) = \arg\max_{\sigma_i \in \Sigma_i} \pi_i(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})
\end{equation}
A strategy profile $\sigma^*$ is said to be a Nash equilibrium if for all players $i$, the strategy $\sigma_i^*$ is the best response to the strategies of all other players, $\sigma_{-i}^*$. This means that no player can improve their utility by unilaterally deviating from their strategy in a Nash equilibrium.

In game theory, achieving Nash equilibrium can be difficult in games with imperfect information, where players lack full knowledge about the game or the other players' actions and strategies.

To address this, we often consider $\epsilon$-equilibrium, a more achievable concept in these scenarios. In an $\epsilon$-equilibrium, no player can gain more than a small value $\epsilon$ by changing their strategy alone, making it a practical approximation to Nash equilibrium in games with imperfect information.

We define a strategy profile $\sigma^\epsilon_i$ to be an $\epsilon$-equilibrium if for all players i, we have:
$$
\pi_i(\sigma^\epsilon_i,\sigma^\epsilon_{-i}) \geq \pi_i(\sigma_i, \sigma^\epsilon_{-i}) - \epsilon
$$
This means that if a player deviates from his $\epsilon$-equilibrium strategy, his payoff can increase by at most $\epsilon$.
\subsubsection{Bayesian Game}
A Bayesian game is a game in which players have private information that affects their payoffs. Each player has a type, which represents their private information, and the type of each player is drawn from a known probability distribution. The type of a player determines the player's payoff function, which is a function of the player's type and the strategies chosen by all players.

We define the type space of player $i$ as $\Theta_i$, which represents all possible types that player $i$ can have. The type distribution of player $i$ is denoted by $p_i$, which is a probability distribution over $\Theta_i$.

We use a quintuple to define a Bayesian game:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \langle \mathcal{P}, \{\Theta_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{P}}, \{\Sigma_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{P}}, \{\pi_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{P}}, \{p_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{P}} \rangle
\end{equation}
Where $\Theta_i$ is the type space, $\pi_i$ is the payoff function of player $i$, and $p_i$ is the type distribution of player $i$.

The Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) is a generalization of the Nash equilibrium concept to Bayesian games. A strategy profile $\sigma^*$ is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium if for all players $i$ and all types $\theta_i$ of player $i$, the strategy $\sigma_i^*(\theta_i)$ is a best response to the strategies of all other players, given the type $\theta_i$ of player $i$.

We can define the best response function of player $i$ given type $\theta_i$ as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^\texttt{BNE}_i=\texttt{BR}^\texttt{BNE}_i(\theta_{-i},\sigma_{-i}) = \arg\max_{\substack{\sigma_i \in \Sigma_i \\ \theta_i\in \Theta_i}} \int_{\Theta_i} \pi_i(\sigma_i,\sigma^\texttt{BNE}_{-i},\theta_i,\theta_{-i})dP_i(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)
\end{equation}
where $P_i=\prod_{j\neq i}p_j(\theta_j)$.

In this paper we only consider symmetric Bayesian games, where all players have the same type space and type distribution.

\section{Monadring Protocol}
We want to formalize the procedure of organizing some partial nodes of an existing blockchain network to form a smaller.
I.e. Implementing this protocol as a plugin of some specific blockchain node programs.
\subsection{Network Architecture}
\subsubsection{Model and definitions}
\paragraph{Hostnet and subnet.}
Consider a network composed of a set of participants $\mathbb{V}$ in which the majority obey a protocol to reach Byzantine Agreement and finality\cite{grandpa} over ledger $\mathcal{L}$.
$\mathcal{S}_{i}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{V}$, \( \mathcal{V} = \mathcal{S}_{0} \cup \mathcal{S}_{1} \cup .. \cup \mathcal{S}_{n-1}  \).
We call $\mathcal{V}$ is a \texttt{hostnet} and $\mathcal{S}_{i}$ is a \texttt{subnet} of $\mathcal{V}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item A node participant \( v \in \mathcal{V} \) could be a member of any $\mathcal{S}_{i}$ at meantime.\( v \in \mathcal{V}, v \in \mathcal{S}_{m} \cap \mathcal{S}_{n} \) is valid.
\item We assume the ledger $\mathcal{L}$ of hostnet maintains all the subnets information in form of a mapping \texttt{subnetid}\( \rightarrow \)\texttt{nodelist}.
\item Any participant of the hostnet could join a specific subnet through proposing a modification over ledger $\mathcal{L}$.
\item Since the ledger $\mathcal{L}$ is under Byzantine Agreement by all participants, the map can be considered a provable information outside any subnets.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Subnet ledger.}
For each subnet $\mathcal{S}_{i}$, all participants \(v_{j} \in \mathcal{S}_{i}\) maintain an independent ledger $\mathcal{L}_{i}$ different from the ledger $\mathcal{L}$ of hostnet, while the root state of each subnet ledger will be recorded in the hostnet ledger, \( \mathcal{L}_{i} \nsubseteq \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{F}(L_{i}) \in \mathcal{L} \).

A subnet could handle query and update requests independently from the hostnet ledger.
We can assume that the subnet ledger has properties as below:

\begin{itemize}
\item The subnet ledger contains all the modification events and each event has an increasemental number as index.
The ledger is expected to be in a deterministic state after the $n_{th}$ event being applied, \(\mathcal{S}_{n+1} = f(\mathcal{S}_{n}, e_{n})\).
\item Particularly, changing the function $f$ is also a kind of event. The first event $e_{0}$ is loading the function.
\item The time complexity of looking up the $n_{th}$ event is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
\item The time complexity of retrieving the maximum event id is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Token.} A \texttt{token} $\mathcal{T}$ of Monadring is a special signal circulates within a subnet.
A node in a subnet can write the subnet ledger only when it holds the token $\mathcal{T}$. The token is similar to a write lock in distributed networks.

\subsubsection{Subnet topology}
The participants of the subnet strictly follows the sequence of the \texttt{nodelist} to form a ring topology.
The \texttt{token} $\mathcal{T}$ of a subnet with $n$ nodes circulates around the subnet following the sequence of the \texttt{nodelist}.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{token} $\mathcal{T}$ of a subnet carries groups of events noted as $\mathbf{G}$ from its sender and the sender{'}s forehead recursively.
\item Group $\mathcal{G}_{i}$ is composed by the node $v_{i}$. It contains a list of modification events originally from its pending request queue, the node{'}s digital signature, a digest of its local ledger after these modification applied, a number $q$ indicates how many times this group should delivered, the \texttt{nonce} of the signer and \texttt{ct} represents the voting data using FHE:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}_{i} = (\mathbf{E} = [e_{k}, e_{k+1}..e_{k+n}], \mathcal{S}_{k+n}, \texttt{signature}, \texttt{nonce}, q, [\texttt{ct},..])
\end{equation}
Where the $\mathbf{E}$ could be empty, the $q$ could be negative, the \(\texttt{signature} = \texttt{sig}(\texttt{nonce}, \mathbf{E}, S_{k+n}, \texttt{nodekey})\).

\item Normally, a token circulates in a subnet with $n$ nodes should always include $n$ groups unless there were malicious behaviors or some nodes went offline.
Whenever a node receives the token, it ought to check the signature for each group.
Then applying all the events of each group and compare the digest with the local ledger.
The $q$ of executed groups should be decreased by 1.

\item If all checks pass, the node should handle transactions from its local queue and compose them as a new group with initial $q=n-1$ to replace previous one in the token.
Then try to deliver the token to its successor.
\end{itemize}

Assume a subnet with $n$ nodes \( v_{0}, v_{1} .. v_{n-1}, n\geq 3\). If no nodes joined the subnet during last round, when a node $v_{i}$ receives the token $\mathcal{T}$, noted as $\mathcal{T}_{i}$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{T}_{i} &=& \mathcal{G}_{i}, \mathcal{G}_{(i + 1)\mod n},.., \mathcal{G}_{(i + n - 1)\mod n}\\
\mathcal{T}_{i+1} &=& \mathcal{G}_{i+1}, \mathcal{G}_{(i+2)\mod n},.., \mathcal{G}_{i}^{\prime}; i+1<n
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Procedures}
\subsubsection{Launching a subnet and rotating subnet members}
To launch a subnet, a publishing procedure similar to publishing a smart contract is required.
It requires a deterministic function $f$ in form of executable binary code.

Once the transaction is confirmed on the hostnet, any nodes can register to become nodes within the subnet.
When the number of registered nodes reaches a certain \texttt{threshold}, these registered nodes will synchronize the function $f$ specified in the registration information and begin running it locally.
The token $\mathcal{T}$ initializes following the order of member registering.
And the \texttt{FHEKeyGen} procedure mentioned in the previous section will be executed.

After surpassing the threshold for registered nodes, subnet nodes need to undergo periodic rotation to ensure randomness and reduce the potential for collusion.
This rotation process can specifically utilize verifiable random function (VRF) or simple pseudo random function using a deterministic seed to select nodes for rotation in and out of the subnet. E.g. The block hash of the end of each epochs.

\subsection{Game Theory Analysis for Monadring}
In this chapter, we discuss how to use game theory in Monadring to design voting mechanisms to ensure the normal operation of the subnet. Here, we analyze the mathematical principles of different voting mechanisms. The significance lies in the fact that each AVS needs to design different voting mechanisms for different subnets. For voters, they hope to maximize their voting benefits. For the subnet, it hopes to distribute as few rewards as possible while ensuring that the entire network consensus is reached as soon as possible. We first introduced some basic game theory concepts, then applied these concepts to the subnets in Monadring. For the case of perfect information games, we provided a theoretically optimal voting strategy. For the case of imperfect information games, voters will try to find the right strategy, that is, $\xi$, to maximize their expected payoffs when reaching the Nash equilibrium. However, AVS designers hope to find the corresponding $\theta$ to minimize the overall payoff.
\subsubsection{Voting Game}
Assume there are $n$ voters, each with a voting weight of $\omega_i$, casting a vote $v\in{\{\top,\bot\}}$. The consensus threshold percentage is $\theta$, and their payoff function is:

\begin{equation}
b(\omega_i; \theta_\top,\theta_\bot, n) = 
\begin{cases}
\beta(\omega_i), & \text{if } \frac{\#(v = v_i)}{n} > \theta_{v_i} \\
-\alpha(\omega_i), & \text{if } \frac{\#(v \neq v_i)}{n} > \theta_{\bar{v}_i} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ and $\theta$ refer to the number of participants and threshold percentage in this subgame, with $\theta_\top+\theta_\bot\geq 1$. We use $N$ and $\theta_g$ to denote the global threshold and number of participants. The $\beta(\omega_i)\geq 0$ and $\alpha(\omega_i)\geq 0$ are the payoff functions for a voter with a weight of $\omega_i$.

We introduce a deterministic information: when voter $i$ votes, they know that there have already been $n^{(i)}\top$ votes for $\top$ and $n^{(i)}\bot$ votes for $\bot$. The threshold required for them in the subgame is:
\begin{equation}
  \theta^{(i)}_\top = 
  \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{if } n^{(i)}_\top \geq \theta_\top\cdot n \\
    \infty, & \text{if } n^{(i)}_\bot \geq \theta_\bot\cdot n \\
    \frac{\theta_\top\cdot n - n^{(i)}_\top}{n - n^{(i)}}, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Therefore, at any point in time, each voter is essentially facing a subgame with parameters $\theta^i\top$, $\theta^i_\bot$, and $n^{(i)}$. In this game, the voter is completely unaware of the voting situation of the remaining $n-n^{(i)}-1$ individuals.
\subsubsection{Perfect Information:$n^{(i)}=i-1$}
\label{sec:perfect_information}
Let's consider a special case where $n^{(i)}=i-1$, meaning that voter $i$ knows the voting behavior of all previous voters. Assuming all voters are rational, when the last voter votes, they know the voting behavior of all previous voters, and they only need to choose a vote that will satisfy the voting result.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rational_n}
  v^*_n = 
  \begin{cases}
    \top, &\text{if }n^n_\top+1>\theta_\top\cdot n\\
    \bot, &\text{if }n^n_\bot+1>\theta_\bot\cdot n\\
    \texttt{r}^{(n)}(\top,\bot) &\sim \mathcal{B}^{(n)}, \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, $v^*$ represents the rational voting result (not the actual vote), where $\mathcal{B}$ is the Bernoulli distribution.
For the $n-1$ voters, if we assume they are rational, they would know the results of $n-2$ votes and $v^*_n$. Then, they can vote similarly to Eqn.~\ref{eq:rational_n} based on these $n-1$ results. Therefore, for any $i$, it can be inferred based on $\{v_1,v_2, \ldots,v_{i-1}\} \cup \{v^*_{i+1},v^*_{i+2},\ldots,v^*_n\}$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rational_i}
  v^*_i = 
  \begin{cases}
    \top, &\text{if }n^{(i)}_\top+1+\sum_{j>i}{E[v^*_j=\top]}>\theta_\top\cdot n\\
    \bot, &\text{if }n^{(i)}_\bot+1+\sum_{j>i}{E[v^*_j=\bot]}>\theta_\bot\cdot n\\
    \texttt{r}^{(i)}(\top,\bot) &\sim \mathcal{B}^{(i)}(v;\theta_\top\cdot n-n^{(i)}_\top,\theta_\bot\cdot n-n^{(i)}_\bot,n-n^{(i)}), \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
If we assume that all other information for all voters is ideal, meaning there is no additional information that makes them more inclined to $\top$ or $\bot$, then $v^*$ is no longer a random variable, but:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rational_determined}
  \texttt{r}^{(i)} = 
  \begin{cases}
    \top, &\text{if }\theta_\top\cdot n-n^{(i)}_\top<\theta_\top\cdot n-n^{(i)}_\bot\\
    \bot, &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
However, the real situation is not like the ideal one, especially for the voters who are closer to the front ($i<\texttt{min}((1-\theta_\top)\cdot n+n_\top^{(i)},(1-\theta_\bot)\cdot n+n_\bot^{(i)})$). According to the Central Limit Theorem, the variance will be higher because they have to estimate the $\texttt{r}$ of other voters.
\subsubsection{Imperfect Information: $n^{(i)}=0$}
\label{sec:imperfect_information}
For the case of $n^{(i)}=0$, where voter $i$ is the first voter and does not know the voting behavior of other voters, their voting result should be a random variable. This situation degenerates into a Bayesian game.
Assume that its distribution is $v^*\sim B(X;\xi)$, where $B$ is the binomial distribution. For voter $i$, the expected payoff is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_top}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top] &= \beta\cdot\sum_{i>\theta_\top\cdot n-1}{\binom{n-1}{i}\xi^i(1-\xi)^{n-1-i}} \\
    &- \alpha\cdot\sum_{i>\theta_\bot\cdot n}{\binom{n}{i}\xi^{(n-i)}(1-\xi)^{i}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_bot}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot] &= \beta\cdot\sum_{i>\theta_\bot\cdot n-1}{\binom{n-1}{i}\xi^{n-1-i}(1-\xi)i}\\
     &- \alpha\cdot\sum_{i>\theta_\top\cdot n}{\binom{n}{i}\xi^{i}(1-\xi)^{(n-i)}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
According to Bayesian Nash equilibrium, we use bayes rule to find the Nash equilibrium:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_topl}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n)] &=   \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]\cdot (1-\xi)\\
    &+ \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]\cdot \xi\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
To find its Nash equilibrium, we take the logarithm of both sides of the equation and find the extreme value of $\xi$ by partial differentiation: We present Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_top} in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_top_partial}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]}{\partial\xi} \\
    &= \beta\cdot (n-1)\binom{n-2}{\theta_\top\cdot n-1}\int^{1-p}_0t^{(n - 1) - (\theta_\top\cdot n - 1) - 1} (1 - t)^{(\theta_\top\cdot n - 1)}\text{d} t\\
    &-\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{\theta_\bot\cdot n}\int^{1-p}_0t^{n - (\theta_\bot\cdot n) - 1} (1 - t)^{\theta_\bot\cdot n}\\
    &= -\beta\cdot (n-1)\cdot \binom{n-2}{n\cdot\theta_\top-1}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\top-1}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\top)-1} \\
    &+\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{n\cdot\theta_\bot}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\bot}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\bot)-1}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similarly, we can find the partial derivative of $\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_bot_partial}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]}{\partial\xi} \\
    &= -\beta\cdot (n-1)\cdot \binom{n-2}{n\cdot\theta_\bot-1}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\bot-1}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\bot)-1} \\
    &+\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{n\cdot\theta_\top}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\top}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\top)-1}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:partial}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n)]}{\partial\xi} &= \frac{\partial\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]}{\partial\xi}\cdot \xi+ \mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]\\
    &+ \frac{\partial\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]}{\partial\xi}\cdot (1-\xi)-\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]\\
    &=-\beta\cdot (n-1)\cdot \binom{n-2}{n\cdot\theta_\top-1}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\top}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\top)-1} \\
    &+\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{n\cdot\theta_\bot}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\bot+1}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\bot)-1}\\
    & -\beta\cdot (n-1)\cdot \binom{n-2}{n\cdot\theta_\bot-1}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\bot-1}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\bot)} \\
    &+\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{n\cdot\theta_\top}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\top}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\top)}\\
    &+\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]-\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]\\
    &=-\beta\cdot (n-1)\cdot \binom{n-2}{n\cdot\theta_\top-1}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\top-1}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\top)-1} \\
    &+\alpha\cdot n \cdot \binom{n-1}{n\cdot\theta_\bot}\xi^{n\cdot\theta_\bot}(1-\xi)^{n\cdot(1-\theta_\bot)-1}\\
    &+\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\top]-\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n )| v_i=\bot]\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Solve Eqn.~\ref{eq:partial} to find the Nash equilibrium $\xi=\frac{\theta_\bot}{\theta_\top+\theta_\bot}$.
With any parameters, $\xi=0$ and $\xi=1$ are the trivial Nash Equilibrium points. When $\alpha=\beta$,$\theta_\top=\theta_\bot$, the Nash equilibrium degenerates to $\xi=0.5$.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of $\theta$}
For the designers of voting mechanisms, their goal is to achieve network-wide consensus at the minimum cost. That is, we should design $\theta, \beta, \alpha$ in such a way that consensus can be effectively reached at the lowest cost (note that these three are not necessarily constants, they could very well be in the form of functions such as $\beta(\theta)$ and $\alpha(\theta)$). Here we only discuss the design of $\theta$, while $\beta$ and $\alpha$ need to be evaluated based on functional analysis, which we will publish in the form of a paper. We derivate the expectation of the payoff function with respect to $\theta_\top$ and $\theta_\bot$. According to Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_top}, We approximately estimate that the likelihood expectation of the derivative of $\theta_\top\cdot n$ at the point $\theta_\top\cdot n -1$ is a Beta distribution. We use $\mathbb{E}_\top$ to abbreviate $\mathbb{E}[b(\omega_i;\theta_\top,\theta_\bot,n)|v_i=\top]$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_top_to_top}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}_\top}{\partial{\theta_\top}}=\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}_\top}{\partial(\theta_\top\cdot n)}\cdot\frac{\partial(\theta_\top\cdot n)}{\partial\theta_\top}= \beta\cdot n \cdot \text{f}_b(\xi;n\cdot\theta_\top,n-n\cdot\theta_\top+1)\cdot{n}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_top_to_bot}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}_\top}{\partial{\theta_\bot}}= -\alpha\cdot n \cdot  \text{f}_b(1-\xi;\theta_\bot\cdot n+1,n-n\cdot\theta_\bot+1)\cdot(n+1)\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_bot_to_bot}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}_\bot}{\partial{\theta_\bot}}= \beta\cdot n \cdot \text{f}_b(\xi;n\cdot\theta_\bot,n-n\cdot\theta_\bot+1)\cdot{n}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expectation_bot_to_top}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}_\bot}{\partial{\theta_\top}}= -\alpha\cdot n \cdot  \text{f}_b(1-\xi;\theta_\top\cdot n+1,n-n\cdot\theta_\top+1)\cdot(n+1)\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $$f_b(x;a,b)=\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}$$ and $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function.
Then the condition for Bayesian Nash Equilibrium is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:partial_theta}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}}{\partial{\theta_\top}}=\frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}_\top}}{\partial{\theta_\top}}\cdot\xi+\frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}_\bot}}{\partial{\theta_\top}}\cdot(1-\xi)= 0\\
    \frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}}}{\partial{\theta_\bot}}=\frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}_\top}}{\partial{\theta_\bot}}\cdot\xi+\frac{\partial{\mathbb{E}_\bot}}{\partial{\theta_\bot}}\cdot(1-\xi)= 0\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Bringing in Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_top_to_top}, Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_top_to_bot}, Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_bot_to_bot}, Eqn.~\ref{eq:expectation_bot_to_top}. Get the analytic solution of $\theta_\top$ and $\theta_\bot$. But generally this analytical solution is not easy to solve, we can solve it by numerical methods.

\subsubsection{Semi-Perfect Information: $0<n^{(i)}<i-1$}
It is worth noting that in general, $\theta_\top$ and $\theta_\bot$ are the same. However, in the typical voting process, especially regarding blockchain consensus schemes, the situation often lies between a perfect information game and an imperfect information game. We refer to this as a semi-perfect game. For instance, in a consensus network, some nodes have already seen part of the voting results before voting, while they haven't seen the rest. After excluding the results they have seen, a voting subgame forms, which is an imperfect information game. And there is a high probability that $\theta_\top \neq \theta_\bot$. In this case, we can refer to the method described in Sec.~\ref{sec:imperfect_information} to characterize this subgame problem.
\subsubsection{Function upgrade}
Function upgrade is a kind of event which should be included in the token $\mathcal{G}$ either.
Only some specific users could initiate this event, wherein the subnet manager submits a transaction to modify the hostnet ledger $\mathcal{L}$ similar to registering a subnet.

Besides the function itself, a digest and version should be included in this transaction. E.g. An executable WASM binary with digest and version.
Thus, once a upgrading transaction is confirmed by hostnet, any members of the subnet could include this event into token $\mathcal{T}$ if the hostnet ledger contains a higher version function but an associated event is absent in the token.

\subsection{Fault Tolerance with FHE}
The hostnet can reach the Byzantine Agreement over $\mathcal{L}$ based on an assumption that the ratio of honest participants $r > \texttt{threshold}$.
We don{'}t expect that a subnet has a same ratio as the honest participants of hostnet, neither we expect that a node was honest on ledger $\mathcal{L}$ would be honest on subnet legder $\mathcal{L}_{i}$.

We want to find a solution to detect the malicious behaviours or nodes offline then exclude them from the subnet by a provable invalidity.

For simplicity, we note $\mathcal{T}_{-i}$ as $\mathcal{T}_{i}$ excluding the $i_{th}$ group. An valid $\mathcal{T}_{i}$ must satisfy properties as below:

\begin{itemize}
\item The $q$ of $\mathcal{G}_{i}$ satisfies \(q \leq 0\). $q=0$ implies no new nodes joined the subnet in this round, while $q < 0$ implies some new nodes have joined the subnet. The node $v_{i}$ can check the \texttt{nodelist} from $\mathcal{L}$.
For rest $q$ of $\forall \mathcal{G} \in \mathcal{T}_{-i}$ are similar.
\item Group $\mathcal{G}_{i} \in \mathcal{T}$ contains a signature using its \texttt{nodekey}.
\item Assume the maximum event id of $\mathcal{G}_{i}$ is $m$. Combine all event lists of $\mathcal{T}_{-i}$ as a single list $\mathbf{E}_{-i}$. Assume the minimal event id of $\mathbf{E}_{-i}$ is $n$.
\(n = m+1\) and $m$ is the maximum event id of node $v_{i}$.
\end{itemize}

Given a token $\mathcal{T}$, any nodes can simply validate it.
If there is a malicious behavior noted as \( \mathcal{G}_{i} = (.., \mathbf{E} = [e_{i}, e_{i+1}, ..], ..) \), the nearest honest successor could place its event group with the smallest common agreed \texttt{eventid}.
i.e. There are two conflicted groups $G_{i}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{G}_{i}$ in a token $\mathcal{T}$. The invalid one contains the node's signature could be used for slashing.


The difference between this procedure and other BFT consensus algorithm is that the former one involves FHE to hide the voting information on each group.
Thus, the subnet could efficiently adapt to small-scale networks and avoid collusion actions.
